#### Turn the crank and the machine will Scream


#### By _**Gronch Smellquist**_

## Description

_A machine that screams at different frequencies, tones, breathiness, volumes, and vibrato depending upon the dials on the side._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Prime the uvula_  
* _Honk the nose_  
* _Throw the entire machine at the wall_  
* _Now your machine is primed to scream. Wind the crank!_  

_Connection to the ScreamTeam server will allow you to share your unique screams of various perceivable meanings and levels of discomfort with everyone. Private servers can be established as well, as long as they are connected to Screamteam.yellsoft.net_

## Known Bugs

_Please do not turn the knob that seems like it does nothing on the back, it is a redacted feature phased out in testing and we are working on replacing it. If you turn it too often, the machine will become depressed at the fact that god left it unfinished and refuse to scream. If this happens, allow it to cry itself out and it will return to working condition in a few hours.
